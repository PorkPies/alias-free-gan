# Alias-Free GAN Pytorch Lightning

This is a fork of Kim Seonghyeon's (rosinality) implementation of Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12423). This version has been adapted to pytorch lightning. The result can be used on a wider variety of hardware including TPUs.

⚠️ Incomplete Project ⚠️

Still todo:

- Finish conversion to pytorch lightning
- Convert upfindn2d and fused_act to ArrayFire to allow for non gpu usage.
